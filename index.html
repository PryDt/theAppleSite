			<p class="c" id="quote">"I never liked apples. In fact, when I was a little girl, my mom wanted to give me apples in my lunch box and I would ask for green peppers. So bizarre... It's funny - I don't have an apple a day, but I can say that I have a few a week." ~ Irrelevant quote by Lana Parrilla</p>
			<p class="c" id="para">Honestly, I don't remember why we became friends. And honestly, I don't care. All that matters is the fact that something led to this, and we are living in this reality. Even though we have very little in common, I am glad to have met you. We are new friends, and it is true that I don't know much about you, but I <em>do</em> that you like apples, so I kinda just wanted to make this novelty. Did I forget anything? Oh yeah... and Happy Birthday!</p>
